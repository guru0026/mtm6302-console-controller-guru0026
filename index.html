            <h1>Inspirational Header</h1>
            <p>I wanted to copy and paste lorem ipsum text, but I decided to type out randome words instead. Here are more random words to fill up my paragraph. This is my third sentence. I ran out of ideas, so this is all I've got. If I want more paragraphs, I will just copy and paste this paragraph's content. Maybe I shoudl've just copied and pasted some lorem ipsum text from a website and made my life easier. On second thought, I could've also just used the lipsum command on vsc. Oh well.. too late now.</p>
